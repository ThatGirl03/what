    <h2>The Complete Project Setup</h2>
    <p>Our project combines the power of the Raspberry Pi 3, MicroSD cards, power bank, solar panel, Sunfounder screen, and other components to create a portable, sustainable, and scalable system. This setup can function independently without a constant internet connection and allows users to interact with the project via a local network. The system is ideal for remote learning, coding experiments, or even mobile computing projects, offering flexibility and educational opportunities for all users. Whether you're powering the Raspberry Pi via solar energy or displaying the interface on the Sunfounder screen, this setup is designed to be efficient, versatile, and adaptable.</p>
